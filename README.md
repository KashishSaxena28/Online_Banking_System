# Online_Banking_System
I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive online banking system using Java, Java Swing, and Java
AWT, with MySQL as the backend database. This project showcased my proficiency in Java programming, as
well as my ability to integrate with databases for data storage and retrieval. Through rigorous testing and
iterative refinement, I ensured the system's reliability, security, and user-friendly interface, demonstrating my
strong problem-solving and software engineering skills.
